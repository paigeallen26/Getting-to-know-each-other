    <h3 style=font-size:2vw> <em>Introduction</em> Hi! My name is Paige, I live in Lockport with
        my parents and my younger sister. We've all become much closer than 
        we already were since quarntine started. I love being with them and going out and 
        doing stuff. I'm currently a Junior and majoring in Secondary Math Education.
        I like it because I get two different degrees, in the speciality and the teaching license. Some of my hobbies would be 
        painting, listening to music, and being with my family.
        When I'm not doing those things, I'm either working
        or doing homework.</h3>

    <h4 style=font-size:2vw> <em>What I Hope to Learn in this Course</em> I hope to learn more about algorithims and functions within this course, I believe 
        these topics will be most useful for my degree. I've already gotten a better understanding of how to navigate through the Computer
        and a brief introduction to Python and Coding, so I'm also looking forward to getting a better understanding of those things.</h4>
